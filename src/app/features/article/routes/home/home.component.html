            For the past 14 years, I have worked with the architecture and the development of software,
            expert in developing and engineering systems using C#, .NET Core, Microservices
            architecture, ASP.NET, MVC, Windows Services, NServicebus with RabbitMQ, Entity
            Framework, Docker, TFS, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL Oracle, MongoDB, BigData, Scrum,

            In the last company I worked for, I was a full-stack engineer who developed a fleet
            management system that integrated with the vehicleâ€™s GPS tracker, developed using
            microservices endpoints created with .NET Core and for the frontend Angular 2 framework.
            I was the engineer leader of two big projects, one related to a handover of a system from
            another team, and the other was in relation to the development of a new project that came
            from an innovative idea that changed the architecture of how our APIs operated that helped
            with the testing and development of new features.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about my job, about new technologies, and using creativity in new projects. I
            adapt very fast to a new work environment.
            I am always reading and studying to improve my knowledge and the use of design patterns,
            clean coding, and new systems architectures.
